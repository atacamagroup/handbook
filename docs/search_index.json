These are just opininated suggestions on making your life easier. There are definitely other ways to do it. Edit this file here. 1.1 Shell Terminals and Command Line Environments You will have to get comfortable with a terminal, such as bash. Lots of scientific computing tools run exclusively or just easier in the terminal. Like learning a new language, you’ll want to start simple and incrementally build your command toolbox. Don’t worry about not being fluent at the start. Experiment with commands occasionally by reading the documentation, which can be accessed using the man command. For example, if you want to learn more about the ls command, you can type man ls to read more. Great places to find a good list of useful commands are the-art-of-command-line and The Grymoire. If you don’t have access to a bash environment or want easy access, take a look at Repl.it, which is a place to experiment with not only bash environments, but also a large list of other programming languages. 1.2 GitHub If you do not already have one, set up a GitHub account account (it’s free). Make sure that you get the education discount so you can set up private repos, plus some other goodies, too. 1.3 R Programming If you don’t already have it, download R and, definitely, RStudio. RStudio has an excellent collection of cheatsheets for different R packages. Miscellaneous resources for R programming: STAT545 - Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R R for Data Science - R specific, but general principles on doing data science from transforming data to communicating. Advanced R - Dig deeper into R. RStudio Resources - Webinars on various R packages and RStudio. 1.4 Python Programming 1.4.1 Anaconda Anaconda is a bundle of software with a package manager, conda, and it installs a variety of popular data science packages. Generally, this should cover most data analysis cases you may encounter. 1.4.2 Conda conda is a package manager and environment manager to help manager your Python instance. Ideally, it should allow you to define your development environment so you can reproducibly create and share your specific development environment. You can get started with conda here. 1.4.3 Jupyter Notebooks Project Jupyter exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages. Jupyter Notebooks should be installed already if you’ve already read through Section 1.4.1. 1.5 Programming Environment Alternatitves Here are some options if you have issues setting up your development environmental locally. Repl.it - Online coding platform with many languages; great for Python but okay for R Google Collaboratory - Run Jupyter Notebooks online 1.6 Windows TODO 1.6.1 Path Management TODO 1.7 macOS TODO 1.8 Linux TODO 1.9 State Server Students in DMICE have access to a server state.ohsu.edu, which can be accessed by ssh username@state.ohsu.edu while replacing username with your school ID. To reduce headaches of managing software installations, it is recommended to use either Linuxbrew (see 1.8) or conda (see 1.4.2). 1.10 Exacloud Compute Cluster Exacloud is the supercomputing cluster resource. If you have access to it, this tutorial will be invaluable to you when you do analyses onto the cluster. "],

General piece of advice is to establish a study group to help bounce around ideas and clarify concepts in a discussion. Note, this still means you are responsible for doing and completing your own homework. The study group is recommended because of the variety of topics you’ll cover and the variety of background your peers possess. There is bound to be a peer of yours that is, say, more skilled in programming that you. But then you may have the upper hand in genetics. Sharing knowledge amongst your peers will ultimately help you all collectively in the end. 4.2.1 BMI 551/651 Statistical Methods Download “An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R”. It’s a easier transition to learning statistical methods and contains R code for you to further experiment and learn from. Here you can find a great video series for the Introduction to Statistical Learning book given by the authors of the book of the same name linked above. Another resource for this introduction book is this repository of notes and exercise attempts to help facilitate comprehension of the book contents. If you feel more statistically and mathematically inclined, the “The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction” textbook is also available. It contains similar content to the introduction text, but without the R code or easier to approach explanations. For some choice topics (e.g., support vector machines, boosting, neural networks), this YouTube series from MIT 6.034 Artificial Intelligence (Fall 2010) is also helpful andw well explained. 4.2.2 BMI 565/656 Programming and Scripting There is Python Tutor to help visualize how and what your computer is doing when it executes code. May help lower the barrier to learning programming. Here’s a short guide on getting started with Python that may prove to be helpful. 4.2.3 CS/EE 559/659 Machine Learning This course is very math heavy, requiring comfort with linear algebra and mathematical statistics notation. Here you can find a machine learning “cheat sheet” of classical equations and diagrams used in machine learning. This guide’s section on “Notation” can be helpful to understand what common mathematical notation in machine learning translates to in more laymans terms. 4.2.4 Miscellaneous Here are some resources that are generally useful: Modern Statistics for Modern Biology - Aim of book is to get scientists working quickly to make best of data. PH525x Series - Biomedical Data Science - Book focuses on performing data analysis in genomics. The Bioconductor 2018 Workshop Compilation - Bioconductor workshop materials as a book for various genomics analyses, ranging from beginner users to expert users who contribute packages. 4.3 Clinical Informatics These are courses underneath the Health and Clinical Informatics (HCIN) program. 4.3.1 Miscellaneous Health Informatics Forum is an online community and educational portal for health informatics professionals and students. It contains lists of resources and it’s own massive open online course (MOOC). 4.4 Fellows Meeting For PhD students and post-docs, think of this time as having over 20 or so human hours of attention given to you if you are presenting. Attention is our more precious resource. Use it wisely. 4.5 Computer Science TODO 4.6 PSU Computer Science TODO 4.7 PSU Statistics TODO 4.8 Independent Study TODO "],

It is a good way to mean other graduate students or other early career researchers and learn how conferences are hosted. Also look for student discounts if possible. If there are none listed, don’t be afraid to email the conference organizers to see if there is a student discount. Locally, you can also apply for travel awards through the Graduate Student Organization (GSO). The deadline to apply is the term before your anticipated travel. Some nearby and prominent conferences to consider: Institute of Systems Biology (ISB) Symposium (Seattle, WA) - Around April, two days, around $50 for students and postdocs. Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB) (Hawaii) - Around January, submit proceedings to be publication. rstudio::conf - Around January, the 2020 conference is in San Francisco, CA.
