These are just opininated suggestions on making your life easier. There are definitely other ways to do it. Edit this file here. 1.1 GitHub If you do not already have one, set up a GitHub account account (it’s free). Make sure that you get the education discount so you can set up private repos, plus some other goodies, too. 1.2 R Programming If you don’t already have it, download R and, definitely, RStudio. RStudio has an excellent collection of cheatsheets for different R packages. Miscellaneous resources for R programming: STAT545 - Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R R for Data Science - R specific, but general principles on doing data science from transforming data to communicating. Advanced R - Dig deeper into R. RStudio Resources - Webinars on various R packages and RStudio. 1.3 Python Programming 1.3.1 Anaconda Anaconda is a bundle of software with a package manager, conda, and it installs a variety of popular data science packages. Generally, this should cover most data analysis cases you may encounter. 1.3.2 Conda conda is a package manager and environment manager to help manager your Python instance. Ideally, it should allow you to define your development environment so you can reproducibly create and share your specific development environment. You can get started with conda here. 1.3.3 Jupyter Notebooks Project Jupyter exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages. Jupyter Notebooks should be installed already if you’ve already read through Section 1.3.1. 1.4 Programming Environment Alternatitves Here are some options if you have issues setting up your development environmental locally. Repl.it - Online coding platform with many languages; great for Python but okay for R Google Collaboratory - Run Jupyter Notebooks online 1.5 Windows TODO 1.5.1 Path Management TODO 1.6 macOS TODO 1.7 Linux TODO 1.8 State Server Students in DMICE have access to a server state.ohsu.edu, which can be accessed by ssh username@state.ohsu.edu while replacing username with your school ID. To reduce headaches of managing software installations, it is recommended to use either Linuxbrew (see 1.7) or conda (see 1.3.2). 1.9 Exacloud Compute Cluster Exacloud is the supercomputing cluster resource. If you have access to it, this tutoria will be invaluable to you when you do analyses onto the cluster. "],

It’s a easier transition to learning statistical methods and contains R code for you to further experiment and learn from. If you feel more statistically and mathematically inclined, the “The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction” textbook is also available. It contains similar content to the introduction text, but without the R code or easier to approach explanations. 4.2.2 BMI 565/656 Programming and Scripting There is Python Tutor to help visualize how and what your computer is doing when it executes code. May help lower the barrier to learning programming. 4.2.3 Miscellaneous Here are some resources that are generally useful: Modern Statistics for Modern Biology - Aim of book is to get scientists working quickly to make best of data. PH525x Series - Biomedical Data Science - Book focuses on performing data analysis in genomics. 4.3 Clinical Informatics These are courses underneath the Health and Clinical Informatics (HCIN) program. 4.3.1 Miscellaneous Health Informatics Forum is an online community and educational portal for health informatics professionals and students. It contains lists of resources and it’s own massive open online course (MOOC). 4.4 Computer Science TODO 4.5 PSU Computer Science TODO 4.6 PSU Statistics TODO 4.7 Independent Study TODO "],

It is a good way to mean other graduate students or other early career researchers and learn how conferences are hosted. Also look for student discounts if possible. If there are none listed, don’t be afraid to email the conference organizers to see if there is a student disscount. Some conferences to consider: Institute of Systems Biology (ISB) Symposium (Seattle, WA) - Around April, two days, around $50 for students and postdocs. Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB) (Hawaii) - Around January, submit proceedings to be publication. rstudio::conf - Around January, the 2020 conference is in San Francisco, CA. American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) Health Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) 5.5 Modern Scientist “How to be a modern scientist” is an affordable book by Jeff Leek on how to navigate the academic world (e.g., publishing, data sharing, blogging, etc.). https://leanpub.com/modernscientist Description: The face of academia is changing. It is no longer sufficient to just publish or perish. We are now in an era where Twitter, Github, Figshare, and Alt Metrics are regular parts of the scientific workflow. Here I give high level advice about which tools to use, how to use them, and what to look out for. This book is appropriate for scientists at all levels who want to stay on top of the current technological developments affecting modern scientific careers. 5.6 Miscellaneous Research Curated list of tools to help with research https://github.com/emptymalei/awesome-research "],
