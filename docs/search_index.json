These are just opininated suggestions on making your life easier. There are definitely other ways to do it. 2.1 General Tips 2.1.1 GitHub If you do not already have one, set up a GitHub account. Make sure that you get the education discount so you can set up private repos, plus some other goodies. 2.1.2 R Programming If you don’t already have it, download R and, if you’d like, RStudio. RStudio has an excellent collection of cheatsheets for different R packages. Miscellaneous resources for R programming: STAT545 - Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R R for Data Science - R specific, but general principles on doing data science from transforming data to communicating. Advanced R - Dig deeper into R. RStudio Resources - Webinars on various R packages and RStudio. 2.1.3 Python Programming 2.1.3.1 Anaconda Anaconda logo Anaconda is a bundle of software with a package manager, conda, and it installs a variety of popular data science packages.
