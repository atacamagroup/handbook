# Introduction {-}

Welcome to the Survival Guide!

This is meant to serve as a bit of a manual or collection of tips for incoming
students to help you transition smoother. These tips are collected from the
experiences of students.

The code for the survival guide is on GitHub [here][ghcode]. Feel free to
contribute any resource or tips you've found useful!
