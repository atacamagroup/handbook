# Introduction {-}

Welcome to the Handbook!

This is meant to serve as a bit of a manual or collection of tips for incoming
students to help you transition smoother. These tips are collected from the
experiences of students.

This Handbook code is on GitHub [here][ghcode]. Feel free to contribute any
resource or tips you've found useful!
