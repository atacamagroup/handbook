## Conferences

If running on a budget, look for opportunities to volunteer at conferences. It
is a good way to mean other graduate students or other early career researchers
and learn how conferences are hosted.

Also look for student discounts if possible. If there are none listed, don't be
afraid to email the conference organizers to see if there is a student
disscount.

Some conferences to consider:

- [Institute of Systems Biology (ISB) Symposium](https://systemsbiology.org/symposium/) (Seattle, WA) - Around April, two days, around $50 for students and postdocs.
- [Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB)](https://psb.stanford.edu/) (Hawaii) - Around January, submit proceedings to be publication.
- [rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) - Around January, the 2020 conference is in San Francisco, CA.
- [American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA)](https://www.amia.org/)
- [Health Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS)](https://www.himss.org/)
