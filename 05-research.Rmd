## Reading Journal Articles

- [Ten simple rules for developing good reading habits during graduate school and beyond (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006467)
- [How to Read a Paper](http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/07/paper-reading.pdf) - Suggests a three-pass method to reading research papers, each pass increasing the depth of details you read into

## Performing dissertation literature review

- [Randolph. "A Guide to Writing the Dissertation Literature Review" (2009)](http://lemass.net/capstone/files/A%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20the%20Dissertation%20Literature%20Review.pdf) (PDF)

Consider using the [matrix method](https://guides.library.duq.edu/matrix) to organize your reviewed sources.

To begin, start with three columns:

| Authors, title, journal                                      | Year Pub | Purpose                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Martin, JE et al. "A DNA vaccina for Ebola virus is safe..." | 2006     | Determine safety and immunogenicity of Ebola vaccine in... |

- Follow academic leaders in your field on Twitter
- [Staying Current in Bioinformatics & Genomics: 2017 Edition](https://www.gettinggeneticsdone.com/2017/02/staying-current-in-bioinformatics-genomics-2017.html)

It is not recommended to use [Sci-Hub](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/07/sci-hub-s-cache-pirated-papers-so-big-subscription-journals-are-doomed-data-analyst) to quickly and easily access almost all of science.

## Writing

## Conferences

If running on a budget,
look for opportunities to volunteer at conferences.
It is a good way to mean other graduate students or other early career
researchers and learn how conferences are hosted.

Also look for student discounts if possible.
If there are none listed,
don't be afraid to email the conference organizers to see if there is a student
discount.

Locally, you can also apply for travel awards through the
[Graduate Student Organization (GSO)](https://ohsugso.weebly.com/gso-travel-award.html).
The deadline to apply is the term before your anticipated travel.

Some nearby and prominent conferences to consider:

- [Institute of Systems Biology (ISB) Symposium](https://systemsbiology.org/symposium/) (Seattle, WA) - Around April, two days, around $50 for students and postdocs.
- [Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB)](https://psb.stanford.edu/) (Hawaii) - Around January, submit proceedings to be publication.
- [rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) - Around January, the 2020 conference is in San Francisco, CA.
- [American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA)](https://www.amia.org/)
- [Health Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS)](https://www.himss.org/)
